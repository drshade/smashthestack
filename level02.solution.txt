Nice interesting one, code requires you to cause an arithmetic overflow in order for a hook function to execute (which gives you shell). First thoughts are to create a divide by zero, but the code guards against this rather well. The alternative approach is to flip the sign of INT_MIN (ffffffffff) by multiplying by -1. The quotient (or positive identical value) is not possibly to represent as a 32-bit int (efffffffff + 1), as it would be identical to the negative value!
